# Entry level

If you're reading this, you at least have google search working, and some phrase, somewhere, on this site caught your attention.

The simple examples in this folder assume some basic knowledge, so lets get you set up.

1. you need a way to run the examples. My personal opinion is that vs code is a decent solution, as you can talk to the github copilot AI. This is a key point of our examples; that new people can benefit from AI agents like github copilot IF they understand the basics of how to communicate with these entities.  Sometimes they are incredibly smart, and generate a page of autocomplete text that works perfectly, and sometimes its way out in left field.  We'll explain how this happens, and how to get back on track.

VS Code is available here:  https://code.visualstudio.com/ 


2. You need to grab a copy of this repo (repository) and put it on your local computer.

Link to repo as a zip file: https://github.com/briankramak/wind_energy_analytical_examples/archive/refs/heads/main.zip 

3. You need to learn about environments, which means there is more softare to install. Minconda is free for experimenters like us.

Minconda:  https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/


There are dozens or hundreds of youtube videos on all three of these topics.  When you're ready, jump back into this folder and we'll step through hte basics of environments and explain how this site is different from others.  We spend a lot of time experimenting, and understanding how to install, fix, or delete environments and start over is really important.

while you are figuring out vs code, make sure you understand extensions, as we'll be installing several.
