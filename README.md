a common task for consultants, analysts, and data scientists is aggregating or classifying data for certain characteristics.  

In the wind energy world, a common grouping is by manufacturer and turbine model.

This simple notebook downloads data from the USGS website and identifies to the top 100 mfr/model combinations (irrespective of HH).

The purpose of the list is to serve as a high level grouping, with additional context added per turbine - hub height, controller revision, real capacity after uprates being key.
